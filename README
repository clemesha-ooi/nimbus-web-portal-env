Example environment using pip, virtualenv, and bundled packages, for the Nimbus portal webapp
============================================================================================

Try it:
-------
    $ cd nimbus-web-portal-env 
    $ python bootstrap.py #create virtualenv and install all bundled packages
    $ source nimbus-web-portal-env/bin/activate #now in the self-contained env

Inspired by this article:
    - http://thraxil.org/users/anders/posts/2009/06/12/Django-Deployment-with-virtualenv-and-pip

But also includes:
    - bundled 'virtualenv.py' (as well as bundled 'pip.py')
    - additions to 'bootstrap.py'

TODO:
    - make sure this environment will work for all deps on the portal webapp
    - integrate code back into nimbus src.
